Bootstrap 4
To make the website application responsive, the Bootstrap 4 framework was used.  The application program of Bootstrap responds to the http request and outputs a dynamic web page with html elements.  To use the framework we insert links to jquery, bootstrap of css and js files. 

Embed 
The div class “embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9” tag and the iframe class of “embed-responsive-item” was used in the html code for the bootstrap framework.  

Viewport
To make the website application responsive, the viewport code was also applied:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

1.  (E)  Security issues

The importance of security for websites includes correct coding especially when creating forms.  The code SQL injection can occur when forms have not been coded with proper coding.  Another security issue is when creating logins and passwords.  Passwords that are not encrypted either in storage or transit are at more risk of interception.  The use of https rather than http is also advisable so that a proper security certificate is used especially if personal information of customers such as credit card details, name, address, etc is submitted via servers. 

HTTP caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

HTTP caching occurs when a browser saves the sessions of users browsing the internet.  If a browser uses a local cache then it avoides the HTTP request.

CDN keeps sites secured with updated TLS/SSL certificates ensuring that authentication, encryption and integrity is maintained. CDN cuts down bandwidth.
